### installation summary

1.  To get started, first pick your OS:

	* https://github.com/e-gun/HipparchiaMacOS
	* https://github.com/e-gun/HipparchiaWindows
	* https://github.com/e-gun/HipparchiaNIX

1. Then you do what your OS install instructions say: 

	e.g: open Terminal.app and paste
	
	`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e-gun/HipparchiaMacOS/master/automated_macOS_install.sh | /bin/bash`

    After watching a lot of messages fly by you will have the full framework. Its probably good news 
    if you see the following: `CONGRATULATIONS: You have installed the Hipparchia framework`

1. After you have installed the software framework, you need to load the data. 
    You either do what it says at

    **either**

	* https://github.com/e-gun/HipparchiaBuilder

    **or**

	* https://github.com/e-gun/HipparchiaSQLoader

    If you know somebody with a build, then you are interested in `HipparchiaSQLoader`.
    Your **reload** (via `reloadhipparchiaDBs.py`) the products of an 
    **extraction** (via `extracthipparchiaDBs.py`).  For example if A ran `extracthipparchiaDBs.py` and then put the `sqldump` folder on a thumb drive, 
    B could move that folder from the drive into his/her `HipparchiaData` folder and then run 
    `reloadhipparchiaDBs.py`. 

    Otherwise you need to build the databases yourself via `HipparchiaBuilder`.
    You put the data in the right place and then run `makecorpora.py`. 

1. Then you will have a working installation. Now it is time to use `HipparchiaServer`. You can `run.py` whenever you want. 
    Mac people even have a handy `launch_hipparchia.app` that can be clicked. 
    
    Once `HipparchiaServer` is running you launch a web browser and (by default) go to http://localhost:5000

    You can leave `HipparchiaServer` running forever, really: it only consumes an interesting 
    amount of computing resources when you execute queries. 
    
    The default settings should work well out of the box. Edit the files in `~/hipparchia_venv/HipparchiaServer/server/settings`
    if you want to change something. For example, `vectors` are off by default and someone who installs
    the proper `python` packages will want to edit `semanticvectorsettings.py` and set `SEMANTICVECTORSENABLED = 'yes'` 
    (and then check the list of vector search types to make sure everything desired has a `yes` next to it)

## FreeBSD SPECIFIC INSTALLATION INFORMATION

You probably need to start here. 

These files should allow you to install an environment with all of the tools to support 
HipparchiaBuilder and HipparchiaServer.

Linux installations will look a lot like FreeBSD installations.

The FreeBSD walkthrough file will build a firewalled server dedicated to Hipparchia. A certain amount of 
prior knowledge is presupposed.
